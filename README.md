# Friends List App

![Screenhot](img/screenshot.png)

This simple application node application has as its only functionality to create a list of friends, on which I will be able to list, delete, edit and insert friends.

I have created it by implementing Node.js and the latest ECMAScript 6 functionality, plus the following packages:

- Inquirer.js
- colors
- dotenv
- pg
- uuid

The database I have used was PostgresSQL (You must have it installed on your computer, and run the queries that I have left you in the database.sql file), as you can confirm by your self.


**Postdata**: Recommended Node.js version: Nodejs >= v13. To start, run **npm install**.
